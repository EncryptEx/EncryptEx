<h1>👋 Hi, I’m Jaume López</h1>
I'm a software developer and engineering student at [UPC Barcelona](https://upc.edu), passionate about creating impactful tech solutions and driving innovation in real-world applications. Over the years, I’ve been deeply involved in projects across hackathons and professional work, focused on everything from user experience design to complex data-driven software solutions.

💻 Currently:

- Leading the Webdev Team at [HackUPC](https://hackupc.com), Europe's largest student hackathon, where my team and I develop platforms like the live schedule, event landing, MyHackUPC portal, and our in-house CTF competition platform.
- Developing my personal website at [jaumelopez.dev](https://jaumelopez.dev), where I showcase my portfolio, projects, and insights into tech, UX, and more.
- Expanding my skills in probability, statistics, and data analysis, and exploring applications in computer science.

🏆 Recent Achievements:

- Best UX Prize at HackMIT 2024 for "Remember Me," a portable device designed to share digital keepsakes through physical storage.
